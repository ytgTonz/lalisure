## 📞 Customer Service

### Handling Customer Questions

**"Why do I need What3Words?"**
> "What3Words helps us find your exact property location, even without a street address. It's especially helpful for claims assessors and emergency services."

**"Why can't I customize my coverage?"**
> "Our simple tier system keeps prices affordable and claims processing fast. You choose the total coverage amount that fits your needs."

**"What if I can't afford the premium?"**
> "Let's look at a lower tier. Even R30,000 coverage is better than nothing. We can also discuss payment plans."

**"How fast are claims processed?"**
> "Most claims are approved within 7-10 days. We've streamlined the process to get you help faster."

### Escalating Issues

Escalate to supervisor if:
- Customer disputes claim denial
- Customer requests special exception
- Technical issue with system
- Customer complaint about service
