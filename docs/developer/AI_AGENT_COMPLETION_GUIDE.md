# AI Agent Completion Guide: Lalisure Insurance Platform

## üéØ **Mission Statement & Context**

You are an AI agent tasked with completing the Lalisure insurance platform. This document provides complete context and instructions for systematic completion, designed to survive context resets and token limitations.

### **Project Overview**

- **Platform**: South African home insurance platform
- **Stack**: Next.js 14, tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Current State**: 40-50% complete (despite docs claiming 75%+)
- **Primary Issue**: Gap between sophisticated code architecture and functional features

### **Critical Discovery**

**Pattern Found**: "Code exists ‚â† Feature works"

- Impressive individual components exist
- Integration between systems is incomplete
- Critical configurations are missing
- Regional mismatches (US code for SA business)

## üîß **PHASE 1: Infrastructure Foundation**

**MUST COMPLETE ENTIRELY BEFORE PHASE 2**

### **Step 1.1: Environment Configuration Audit**

```bash
# Check current environment setup
TASK: Review .env.example vs implementation requirements
VERIFY: Each service has proper configuration
SERVICES TO CHECK:
  - RESEND_API_KEY (email service)
  - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER (SMS)
  - PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY, PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY (payments)
  - CLERK_SECRET_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (auth)
  - DATABASE_URL (database)

ACTIONS:
1. Create/update .env.local with all required variables
2. Document each variable's purpose
3. Test each service connection
```

### **Step 1.2: Database Schema Validation**

```bash
# Ensure database matches code requirements
LOCATION: Check prisma/schema.prisma vs code usage

VERIFY TABLES EXIST:
  - Email (for email tracking)
  - EmailTemplate (for template system)
  - Notification (for notification system)
  - EmailTracking (for delivery tracking)

ACTIONS:
1. Run: npx prisma db push
2. Verify: npx prisma studio (check tables exist)
3. Test: Database connection in application
```

### **Step 1.3: Regional Localization Fix**

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Fix South African phone validation
LOCATION: src/lib/services/sms.ts
PROBLEM: Lines 108-109 use US phone format

CURRENT CODE:
const phoneRegex = /^\+1[0-9]{10}$/;

REPLACE WITH:
const phoneRegex = /^\+27[0-9]{9}$/; // South African format

ALSO UPDATE:
- cleanPhoneNumber method (lines 86-101)
- Add SA country code logic instead of US
- Update validation messages
```

### **Step 1.4: Service Configuration Validation**

2. **SMS Service**: Wrong country validation (US vs SA)
3. **Payment Webhooks**: Multiple TODO items incomplete
4. **Environment Setup**: Missing critical API keys
5. **Database Schema**: Potential mismatches with code

### **Configuration Requirements:**

```env
# Required environment variables
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+27_your_sa_number
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=your_paystack_secret
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=your_paystack_public
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### **Regional Fixes Required:**

- Phone number validation: US (+1) ‚Üí South Africa (+27)
- SMS templates: Remove US references
- Business logic: Adapt to SA insurance regulations
