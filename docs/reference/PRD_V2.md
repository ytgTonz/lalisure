## üÜï **V2 NEW FEATURES & CHANGES**

### **Major New Features**

#### **Feature 1: Policy verification for auth**

**Description**: The mobile version of the platform will take the policy number and verify the user by sending an OTP to the user number to verify the user and create session that will be managed by the backend and log them in. Session expires after 30 days in which the user will have to log back in again.

**User Stories**:

- As a [CUSTOMER], I want to [user mobile app by verifying that the policy is mine using my number] so that [I am auth to access my information]
- As a [AGENT], I want to [use the platform] so that [create a policy for the customer and for it to be approved by my supervisor]
- As a [supervisor], I want to [use the platform] so that [can accept/confirm/ reject/ deny policy and claim creation and modification]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Policiy is created by Agent and not customer.
- [ ] policy is approved by supervisor.
- [ ] policy number is communicated back to customer and is used to access mobile application by sending otp to customer.

**Priority**: High

---

#### **Feature 2: Simplified Tier-Based Coverage System**

**Description**: Replace complex policy customization with fixed coverage tiers ranging from R30,000 to R200,000. This simplifies the purchase process and makes pricing more transparent for rural customers. Coverage amounts: R30k, R50k, R75k, R100k, R150k, R200k.

**User Stories**:

- As a CUSTOMER, I want to choose from simple coverage tiers so that I can easily understand what I'm buying
- As an AGENT, I want to quickly create policies using predefined tiers so that I can serve more customers efficiently
- As a SUPERVISOR, I want to review tier-based policies quickly so that approval is faster

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] System supports 6 fixed coverage tiers (R30k-R200k)
- [ ] Premium calculation is automatic based on tier selection
- [ ] Tier selection UI is simple and mobile-friendly
- [ ] Historical custom policies remain accessible but new policies use tiers only

**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 5 story points
**Dependencies**: Database schema update, pricing calculation service

---

#### **Feature 3: What3Words Address Integration**

**Description**: Integrate What3Words (W3W) API for location verification in rural areas without traditional street addresses. This allows customers and agents to precisely identify property locations using a 3-word address format.

**User Stories**:

- As an AGENT, I want to capture property location using What3Words so that I can insure homes without street addresses
- As a CUSTOMER, I want my rural home to be accurately located so that claims assessors can find my property
- As a SUPERVISOR, I want to verify property locations on a map so that I can approve policies with confidence

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] What3Words API integration for address lookup
- [ ] Map display showing W3W location
- [ ] Address validation and verification workflow
- [ ] Mobile-friendly W3W input interface
- [ ] Fallback to GPS coordinates if W3W unavailable

**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 8 story points
**Dependencies**: What3Words API subscription, map integration service

- Mobile-responsive agent interface

**Rationale**: Improve agent productivity and enable mobile-first agent workflow
**Impact**: Agents can create policies faster, work from mobile devices in the field

## üë• **USER PERSONAS & ROLES**

### **V1 Roles** (Continuing in V2)

1. **Customer** - End users buying insurance
2. **Agent** - Sales agents creating policies
3. **Underwriter** - Risk assessment specialists
4. **Staff** - Customer support staff
5. **Admin** - System administrators

### **New V2 Roles** (If Any)

1. **Supervisor** - Monitors and has higher previlieges than agent and can approve/deny policy and claims
2. **SuperAdmin** - System administrators
3. **Admin** - User Admin

**Key Note:**

#### **[New Role Name]**

_The (Admin, SuperAdmin) split up the task of just the single admin_
_Underwriter role has been deleted and replaced my Supervisor Role_

---

## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **Architecture Changes**

_[To be filled: Will the architecture change significantly?]_

**Current V1 Architecture**:

- Frontend: Next.js 15 + React 19
- API: tRPC
- Database: MongoDB + Prisma
- Auth: Dual (Clerk + JWT)

**Proposed V2 Changes**:

- [x] Keep current architecture
- [ ] Remove clerk dependency for mobile auth: Users will have to auth using OTP sent to their phone. Here is how it will work. A user will input their Policy Number, that policy will be looked up on the database and will retrieve the number of the customer owning that policy in a hidden format (083XXXX16). The user will be prompted to input their details and an otp will be sent to their phone for auth.

**Rationale**: These changes are included because of the complex nature of relying on external clerk auth systems to manage session handling.
