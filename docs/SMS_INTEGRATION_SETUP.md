## Setting Up Twilio

### 1. Create Twilio Account

2. Sign up for a new account or log in
3. Complete account verification

### 2. Get Account Credentials

1. From the Twilio Console Dashboard
2. Find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**
3. Copy these to your environment variables

### 3. Get a Phone Number

1. Go to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Buy a number**
2. Choose a phone number (preferably with SMS capabilities)
3. Purchase the number
4. Copy the number to `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` (include country code, e.g., +27123456789 for South Africa)

### 4. Configure Webhook (Optional)

For delivery status tracking:

1. Go to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Active numbers**

## SMS Message Templates

```

```

## Testing SMS Integration

### 1. Test in Development

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Test SMS sending via API or admin panel
```

### 2. Test with Trial Account

- Twilio trial accounts can only send SMS to verified phone numbers
- Add your phone number to verified caller IDs in Twilio Console
- Trial accounts include "Sent from your Twilio trial account" prefix

### 3. Production Setup

- Upgrade to a paid Twilio account for production use
- Remove trial limitations
- Configure proper sender ID if available in your region

## User Phone Number Requirements

### Phone Number Format

- Must include country code (e.g., +27123456789)
- Automatically formatted by the SMS service
- Invalid numbers are rejected with error messages

### User Profile Updates

Users can add/update phone numbers in:

- User profile settings
- Account registration
- Admin user management

## SMS Preferences (Future Enhancement)

Currently, SMS is sent automatically when:

- User has a valid phone number in their profile
- Email notifications are enabled for the event type

Future enhancements may include:

- User preference controls for SMS notifications
- Opt-in/opt-out functionality
- Different notification preferences per type

## Cost Considerations

### Twilio Pricing

- SMS costs vary by destination country
- South Africa: ~$0.05 per SMS
- Set up billing alerts in Twilio Console
- Monitor usage in Twilio Console

### Usage Optimization

- SMS is only sent when user has phone number
- Failed SMS attempts are logged but don't retry automatically
- Consider implementing delivery status tracking for critical messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SMS not being sent**

   - Check Twilio credentials in environment variables
   - Verify phone number format includes country code
   - Check Twilio Console for error logs

2. **Trial account limitations**

   - Verify recipient phone number in Twilio Console
   - Upgrade to paid account for unrestricted sending

3. **Phone number validation errors**
   - Ensure phone numbers include country code (+27 for South Africa)
   - Check user profile has valid phone number

### Error Logging

SMS errors are logged in:

- Application console
- Twilio Console > Monitor > Logs
- Application notification logs

### Support

For Twilio-specific issues:

- [Twilio Documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms)
- [Twilio Support](https://support.twilio.com/)

For application-specific issues:

- Check application logs
- Verify environment configuration
- Test with valid phone numbers

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Never commit Twilio credentials to version control
   - Use secure environment variable management in production
   - Rotate credentials periodically

2. **Phone Number Privacy**

   - Phone numbers are stored securely in user profiles
   - SMS content doesn't include sensitive data beyond basic policy/claim info
   - Consider data retention policies for phone numbers

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Twilio has built-in rate limiting
   - Consider implementing application-level rate limiting for bulk operations
   - Monitor for unusual SMS volume
